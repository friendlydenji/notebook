Our world is *analog* but computer's world is *digital* \
**analog** refers to a continuously changing representation of a continuously variable quantity \
**digital** refers to representing these variable quantities in terms of actual numbers, or digits \
So we have to do something for computers to understand our world, there will be discuss in [ADC & DAC](#adc--dac) part

## 3.2. Embedded Systems
Embedded system is computer system with a **dedicated function** *embedded* as a part of a complete device and have limited resources as *memory*, *peripheral*, *speed*, ... \
They have some features as: *small size*, *low per-unit cost*, *low power consumption*, ...

## 3.3. Cypher-Physical Systems
### Stay tuned !
This part will be added later

## 3.4. Sensors & Actuators
**Sensors** are devices that measure physical quantities \
`sensor` can be seem as input of a system, it responsible to *"read from physical world"* \
**Actuators** are devices that modify physical quantities \
`actuator` can be seem as output of a system, it responsible to *"write to physical world"* 

## 3.5. Internet of Things
